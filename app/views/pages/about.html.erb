<h1>About Revive Clothiers</h1>
<p>Revive Clothiers was founded in 2011 with one mission in mind: to offer a connection to the refined masculinity of our collective past through menswear.</p>
<p>We believe that clothing is more than just a means to an end; it is a pure expression of self. This isn't fashion, <strong>it's style</strong>. The kind of style that's timeless. The heart of menswear is in the history. The history of the cloth, the tailor, the shoemaker. we aim to share that essence with our customers with every item that we sell. The connection between from where we've come, to where we'll go.</p>
<p>Every item that we offer is an embodiment of the passion tha we feel for the culture of menswear. Whether you're looking for a one-of-a-kind vintage piece or just a great quality suit or dress shirt, you're sure to find the value in everything that we sell.</p>
<p>We're a different kind of men's clothier. Everything we offer has been reclaimed or is made from reclaimed materials. It turns out that when using the best quality materials and workmanship, it's actually pretty hard to wear it out! We aim to insure that clothing that was made to last a lifetime gets worn for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Of course, everything is throughly inspected to make sure that it's up to our high standards. Loose stitching is fixed, garments are repressed, shoes are refinished, repaired and polished as needed, trousers are un-hemmed and alterations are reversed along with whatever else is necesssary. Basically, we make sure that each item is ready to be passed on to its new owner.</p>
<p>What about the stuff that doesn't make the cut? We use it too. Cloth is reclaimed and turned into ties, bow ties or pocket squares. A vintage leather jacket might be reconditioned and its lining replaced. High waisted trousers can be re-cut, pleats can be removed.</p>
<p>We want to share our passion with you. We take your satisfaction seriously and we guarantee everything that we sell. We size and sell everything by actual measurements and offer alterations to get a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Dress is an outward expression of self. It's a ritual that, for generations, has been passed down from father to son. We strive to re-establish that connection.</p>
